# 🌸 Anshin Workflow Protocol (AWP)

**Protecting organizations and empowering employees through human-centric, USB-based security.**

## 🛡️ What is Anshin Workflow Protocol?

Anshin Workflow Protocol (AWP) is a lightweight, human-centered security framework that simplifies authentication while protecting corporate systems. It reduces common security risks by focusing on real-world human behavior and simplifying digital access through physical USB tokens.

---

## 🌸 Core Concepts

- **USB-Based Access:** Employees clock in, verify ID, and receive a USB device that grants limited, permissioned access to work systems.
- **Automatic Lockout:** Removal of the USB instantly locks the environment.
- **Threat Response Built-In:** Employees can remove the USB under duress, locking systems immediately without needing to remember complex steps.
- **24-Hour Rotating Keys:** (Optional) For additional corporate security layers.
- **Minimal Access by Default:** Employees only access what is required for their roles — reducing insider threats.

---

## 🛡️ Benefits

- **Prevents Phishing:** Reduces reliance on traditional passwords.
- **Reduces Human Error:** No more forgotten passwords or unsafe practices.
- **Scalable and Simple:** Works for small businesses and large enterprises.
- **Humane:** Designed to protect employees without overburdening them.

## 🛡️ Closing Thought

*"Security should feel like peace, not imprisonment.  
Anshin Workflow Protocol exists to protect people,  
not control them."*

# ✍️ Author's Note

I simply wanted to create something that was extremely simple and essentially eliminated passwords in a workplace, while protecting employees, companies, and organizations alike.

The entire basis for this idea was:  
- No more stress for employees trying to manage complex passwords.  
- No more fear after accidentally clicking a bad link.  
- A permanent safety net for both people and data.

If we can somehow simplify everything for everyone — and make things better — that's all I could ever hope for.  
It is my sincere wish that this idea and protocol can help protect many lives and many futures.

Hope you all like it.  
Stay Super Awesome! :3
