## 🛡️ What is Anshin Workflow Protocol?

Anshin Workflow Protocol (AWP) is a lightweight, human-centered security framework that simplifies authentication while protecting corporate systems. It reduces common security risks by focusing on real-world human behavior and simplifying digital access through physical USB tokens.

## 🌸 Core Concepts

- **USB-Based Access:** Employees clock in, verify ID, and receive a USB device that grants limited, permissioned access to work systems.
- **Automatic Lockout:** Removal of the USB instantly locks the environment.
- **Threat Response Built-In:** Employees can remove the USB under duress, locking systems immediately without needing to remember complex steps.
- **24-Hour Rotating Keys:** (Optional) For additional corporate security layers.
- **Minimal Access by Default:** Employees only access what is required for their roles — reducing insider threats.

## 🛡️ Benefits

- **Prevents Phishing:** Reduces reliance on traditional passwords.
- **Reduces Human Error:** No more forgotten passwords or unsafe practices.
- **Scalable and Simple:** Works for small businesses and large enterprises.
- **Humane:** Designed to protect employees without overburdening them.
